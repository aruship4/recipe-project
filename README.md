# Investigating the Relationship Between Protein Content and Recipe Ratings

Author: Arushi Patra

## Overview

This data science project (for the DSC 80 class at UCSD) aims to investigate the relationship between protein content and ratings for a recipe.

## Introduction

The question my project is investigating is: Do recipes with higher protein level tend to get higher recipe ratings? My dataset, Recipes and Ratings, comes from food.com. It contains two CSV's: one for recipes (RAW_recipes.csv) and one for interactions (RAW_interactions.csv), which holds ratings and revies submitted for the recipes in RAW_recipes.csv.

Provide an introduction to your dataset, and clearly state the one question your project is centered around. Why should readers of your website care about the dataset and your question specifically? Report the number of rows in the dataset, the names of the columns that are relevant to your question, and descriptions of those relevant columns.

## Baseline Model

My baseline model predicts the protein content of recipes by standardizing numerical nutrition features (calories and carbohydrates) and transforming recipe tags into numerical features using TF-IDF, then fitting a linear regression model to learn patterns in the data.
