# Investigating the Relationship Between Protein Content and Recipe Ratings

Author: Arushi Patra

## Overview

This data science project (for the DSC 80 class at UCSD) aims to investigate the relationship between protein content and ratings for a recipe.




## Baseline Model

My baseline model predicts the protein content of recipes by standardizing numerical nutrition features (calories and carbohydrates) and transforming recipe tags into numerical features using TF-IDF, then fitting a linear regression model to learn patterns in the data.
